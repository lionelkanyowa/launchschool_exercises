# q.7 predict the output of the code shown below. When you run the code, do you see what you 
# expected? Why or why not?

list1 = [2, 6, 4]
list2 = [2, 6, 4]

print(list1 == list2)

# prediction: the output here will be `True`, this is because when `list1` and `list2` are 
# evaluated using the comparison operator, the values are compared and since they are equal to 
# each other, the return value will be 'True'

# When the code was ran, the output was indeed 'True'.
